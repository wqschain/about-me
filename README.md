## About Me

I'm a third year Computer Science student passionate about building purposeful, data driven software. I focus on blending clean backend architecture with sleek user interfaces to create tools that are as functional as they are elegant. My interests span from real time data visualization, crypto infrastructure, and financial markets to automation, performance tuning, and building experimental interfaces. Whether it's designing dashboards or fine tuning logic behind the scenes, I enjoy crafting systems that feel as smooth as they are smart.
